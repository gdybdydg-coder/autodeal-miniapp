# AUTODeal backend — staging, delivery disabled

The GitHub Pages Mini App retains device-local drafts and now offers explicit
server saving through https://autodeal-api.onrender.com. The Telegram SDK supplies
raw initData; the API validates the signature and user ownership. No automatic
import occurs. Cloud saves always use enabled=false. A separate cloud list supports
read-back, restoring filters, and confirmed deletion. Open from a Telegram Mini App
button, not a normal browser link. No session data or bot token is persisted by the
client. Render hosting has been provisioned; authenticated end-to-end cloud saving
still requires an owner test inside Telegram. No webhook or worker is configured
by this integration. Real listings and valuation are still absent.

Frontend checks: `node --test cloud-test.cjs`, `node filter-test.cjs`,
`node storage-test.cjs`. The DOM harness checks behavior, not rendered visual layout.

## Components

- FastAPI subscription API; PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy (SQLite only in local tests).
- Raw Telegram initData HMAC validation, one-hour expiry and per-user ownership.
- Private /start and /stop webhook with a secret header; no unsolicited startup messages.
- Trusted internal listing ingestion; NO scraper or valuation algorithm yet.
- Matching of body, fuel, transmission, price/year and mileage, minimum 15% below
  the supplied market estimate. At least five comparables must be declared by the
  future trusted valuation adapter. This is a guard, not a valuation model.
- Delivery deduplication per Telegram user and source listing, across all searches.
- Pending messages recheck consent/filters/freshness immediately before sending.
- 429 retry scheduling, 403 disables delivery. Ambiguous network outcomes are
  quarantined as uncertain rather than retried and potentially duplicated.

## Local development

From the repository root, in a dedicated Python 3.12+ virtual environment:

```sh
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pytest backend/tests -q
uvicorn backend.app:factory --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Set DATABASE_URL, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and a random TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET of at
least 32 characters through server-only environment variables. PostgreSQL URL:
`postgresql+psycopg://...`. The two delivery flags default to false.
No dotenv file is loaded automatically. Tests use fake tokens, isolated SQLite
databases and injected fake senders; they never contact Telegram.

## API

Authenticated requests supply raw Telegram.WebApp.initData in the
`X-Telegram-Init-Data` header, never a browser-supplied user/chat ID.

- GET /health — read-only database probe: 200 with database=connected and
  database_type, or 503 with database=unavailable. Does not return credentials,
  user data or database error details. Reports delivery_available but does not
  verify the Telegram token, listing source, schema integrity or delivery.
- GET /api/subscriptions — this user's searches.
- POST /api/subscriptions — {name, filters, enabled}; filters match the Mini App's
  names and kilometre units (mileage bounds are in thousands). Same filters update
  one subscription. Maximum 20 per user.
- PATCH /api/subscriptions/{id} — {enabled: true/false}.
- DELETE /api/subscriptions/{id} — owner-only deletion.
- POST /telegram/webhook — Telegram-only, secret header required.

Enabling requires both server flags and a verified private /start. /start never
re-enables old searches after /stop. A new/re-enabled search only considers
listings ingested after activation, preventing a flood of old advertisements.
No silent import of device-local notification preferences is implemented.

## Deployment gates — approval required

1. Choose/authorize hosting and review its current costs before resource creation.
2. Provision PostgreSQL and an HTTPS API. Add secrets through the provider UI,
   never chat, source control, front-end JS or request logs.
3. Review existing bot webhook/polling before any change; do not replace an existing
   bot integration without approval. Register this webhook deliberately with
   secret_token and allowed_updates=["message"]. No registration happens on boot.
4. Integrate an authorized real listing source and valuation process, map vocabulary
   to the frontend, validate freshness/source identity. No real data source exists yet.
5. Connect Mini App to API: load official Telegram SDK, validate initData server-side,
   explicitly confirm each cloud subscription and request write access/start as needed.
6. Run a single approved test to the owner's verified private bot chat.
7. Only then enable flags and configure a worker schedule/rate budget.

Worker entry: `python -m backend.worker`; one invocation attempts at most one message.
The initial implementation scans listings, intended for small-scale staging only.
Add incremental ingestion cursors, indexes/batching and per-chat rate limits before
large-scale use. Add reverse-proxy request/body/rate limits and database backups.
Use one API worker initially. User creation handles uniqueness conflicts with a
savepoint; PostgreSQL user-row locks serialize existing-user edits.
Production PostgreSQL/concurrency behaviour has not been tested here.

Exactly-once Telegram delivery cannot be guaranteed across a crash after sending.
Rows left in sending/uncertain are not automatically retried; investigate manually.
This chooses avoiding duplicate messages over guaranteed delivery. A message already
in flight at /stop cannot be recalled. Commands are ordered by message date and
update_id, accommodating Telegram's update ID reset after long inactivity.

Do not expose database/admin ingestion endpoints to the Mini App. Names, tokens and
initData must not be logged. User IDs/filters are personal data: decide retention,
account deletion and the privacy notice before accepting other users.
# AUTO.RIA connection check

Set server-only `AUTO_RIA_API_KEY` in Render. On startup, a one-time check calls
the documented used-car search (one newest active passenger-car ID) and info
endpoints, at most two requests in total. No paid valuation endpoints are used.
The claim is committed in the new `source_probes` table before any network call;
failures, process crashes and redeploys do not automatically retry. If a check
fails, investigate its status before explicitly arranging another attempt.

`GET /api/source-status` reads the cached check without contacting AUTO.RIA.
It exposes only a fixed status, timestamp, requests reserved, and a small public
listing preview. It never returns the key, upstream errors, seller data or VIN.
The preview is a historical connectivity sample, not a current search result.
The `checking` state can remain after an interrupted startup; it is not a retry loop.
`connected_empty` means a valid empty search, not verified listing details.

This does not connect Mini App filters, calculate a market price, ingest delivery
listings, start a worker, or change `SOURCE_READY` / `DELIVERY_ENABLED`.
Both flags must remain false during integration. Source attribution:
